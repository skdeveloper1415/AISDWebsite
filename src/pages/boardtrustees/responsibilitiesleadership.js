          Guiding the Austin Independent School District toward excellence is
          the goal of the nine-member AISD Board of Trustees. As the district's
          elected leaders, trustees represent community expectations as they
          chart the direction of educational programs and services and establish
          the standard by which success is measured.

          Trustees employ the superintendent, approve the budget and monitor
          expenditures, set the tax rate, and may call for a bond or tax rate
          election. The board also establishes policies for operating the
          district and ensuring its financial viability.

          Members are elected to a four-year term of office. On a rotating
          basis, board seats are filled during biannual elections held on the
          first Tuesday in November. Vacancies are filled by appointment until
          the next election. Candidates must conform to the eligibility
          requirements of the Texas Election Code. The president, vice president
          and secretary are elected by the other members of the board. Trustees
          provide public service to the Austin community without financial
          compensation.
